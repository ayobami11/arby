                <h2>Problem Discovery</h2>
                <p>“Sellers of digital spare parts need a simple and trustworthy way to connect to their potential buyers”</p>
                <p>
                    As a designer, I use and buy and change digital products very often. In some cases, where a certain part of my device gets
                    broken, I order a replacement spare-part instead of buying another device. Ive noticed how difficult it is to sell digital
                    spare-parts without having the fear of getting cheated.  Upon talking to a close friend, I realized that I wasn&apos;t the
                    only one who had this fear. I identified this as a problem and asked myself why was there a fear in selling digital spear-parts.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>“9 out of 10 participants confirmed that trust was a limiting factor to finding the right buyers of digital spare-parts”</p>
                <p>
                    I recruited 10 participants to fill out a survey. Upon analysing the results, 9 out of the 10 participants confirmed that they
                    encountered problems finding buyers for digital spare parts, and the most important limiting factor was trust.

                <h2>User interviews</h2>
                <p>
                    I invited <strong>five</strong> participants who participated in the user survey for a <strong>one-one</strong> user
                    interview to learn more about their frustrations selling digital spare parts. I wanted to find out ways to create trust
                    between sellers and future potential clinets.

                    <li>Did you sell the item in person, or was it virtual? Can you please explain?</li>

                <h2>Interview Findings</h2>
                <p>
                    After interviewing my participants, I carefully understood the frustartions and points that my participants had made.
                    I studied their frustrations carefully and came up with three points which would futher drive my reserach.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        All participants verified that there was difficulty finding and connecting to buyers that needed digital parts, except
                        they had a connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3 out of 5 participants said they were put in compromising positions before and forced to reduce their initial selling
                        price of items because close family members referred the buyers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some participants stated that it was hard to trust buyers because of the fear of getting cheated.
                    </li>

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Based on the responses from my participants, I discovered 2 significant challenges that I faced:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How could I create trust between the sellers and buyers virtually?</li>
                    <li>How do sellers get reassurance that they are getting the best deals and aren&apos;t being cheated?</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Competitive analyisis</h2>
                <p>“Understanding your competition is key to a excellent design”</p>
                <p>
                    I proceeded to conduct a competitive analysis after studying the challenges that I faced, . With the help of my competion,
                    I understood how my competition created trust to their customers through the help of ratings, reviews and referrals. I
                    was able to understand some of the policies that the competition had that favoured both the buyers and the sellers.

                <blockquote>Knowing what your audience&apos;s actions can help you cater better to their needs</blockquote>
                <p>
                    After getting to know my competition and how they handled some of the challenges I had encountered, I proceeded to knowing
                    more about my target audience and understand their challenges better by creating an emapthy map.

                <p>
                    With the information I had gotten from my research, and with the help of empathy mapping, I was confident enough and proceeded
                    to design my user persona. The user persona was based on a student and part-time project manager at a start-up, Debbie lawson,
                    who represented the majority of my target audience.

                <p>
                    I proceeded to paper sketches, iterating as much on the design as I could. My intention was to give shoppie a minmalist and
                    easy look that was userfriendly and instilled trust within my targeted users.

                <h2>Style Guide</h2>
                <p>
                    For the high fidelity designs, I chose the color orange. Orange is a trust worthy color that has been proven to give the
                    users a sence of trust and security. This was the message that Shoppie needed to convey to its users.

                <p>
                    In other to get feedback from my targeted users, I proceeded to usability testing with close friends and family. I set
                    goals for my target audience and patiently obseved as my users set out to acheive the goals assigned to them.

                <h2>Project Take-aways</h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest challenge when working on this particular project was time, I had to come up with the research, design and
                    case-study roughly between 2-3weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second challenge was recruiting participants, It was challenging to recruit participants, I had to reach out to a
                    couple of friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because it was a solo-project it was quite difficult to convey the feeling of trust into a feature, however after
                    reviewing some feedback from mentors and revisiting my competition, I was able to find a solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, it was an amazing experience to find out that, I wasnt the only one who struggled fining sellers of digital
                    spare-parts. I learnt a lot from research and designing shoppie.
