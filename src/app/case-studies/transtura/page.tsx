                <h1>Transtura: Revamping the share ride experience</h1>
                <p>
                    The transtura app allows users to book bus rides from their nearest destination to another through the share
                    ride feature. As someone who uses mobility applications regularly, after using the transtura app, I realized
                    that Trantura had a poor <strong>user experience</strong> through its <strong>poor feedback</strong>,
                    <strong>limited bus choices</strong>, and <strong>poor aesthetics</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I went to playstore to access some of the reviews and comments made by existing customers . I made a hypothesis based on the
                    responses.

                <p>
                    I went further to talk to the team of Rranstura. After talking with the team and two customers, I understood the goal of
                    transtura and some of the frustrations that was encountered while using the app.  I came up witha problem statement based
                    on the feedback I had received.

                    Transtura users are frustrated by the limited ride choices, poor user experience, and visual aesthetics involved when booking
                    a ride via the share ride feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a user books a ride on transtura through the share ride feature, the user automatically gets assigned to a driver instead
                    of having a choice to select a driver.The user has a poor experienes by having no notifications in key processes sucah as cash
                    refunding and awaiting drival acceptance. The app is odutated with its visual asetheics. These were problems I identified
                    Transtura faced.

                <p>
                    Still keeping my goal in mind, I conducted a competitve analysis and learnt from how the competition provided user
                    satisfaction and flexibily by giving users the best choices that fit their purchasing capacity. With the help of my
                    competition, I learnt how to improve the user experience of Transtura by always notifying the users at the right time
                    and providing alternate routes to the users incase something went wrong.

                    The old-user flow had missing processes and lacked alternatives routes and fallback processes. Users werent notified when
                    a driver failed to accep their requests, users lacked flexibility when ordering for bus rides and payment refunds.

                    the driver not responding in time. I also gave users more flexibility when ordering bus rides.

                <p>
                    I created the design system of Transtura using brighter greys which were much easeier on the eyes. The previous design of
                    Transtura had too many bold colors, that made transtura less visually appealing and also poor accesssiblity. The new style
                    guide made use of grey colors that was much more easier to look at with better accessiblity.

                <h2>Share Ride Flow</h2>
                <p>
                    The shared ride is the main feature of Transtura, and users can conveniently take other bus rides from their nearest bus
                    stop to their destination bus stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - For this feature, I improved the user flow and implemented the bus ride type, where the users can select a particular
                    Transtura bus ride based on their purchasing power.

                    <li>
                        The previous design had a confusing experience as users could not differentiate between the upcoming and previous last rides.

                    <li>
                        I learnt a lot working on transtura, users and the most important was users needed an alterantive route incase something went 
                        wrong on an application. Not having alternative routes or having poor ones on an application will result in users having a poor 
                        experience.

                    <li>
                        IUsers do not like being constarined to choices, it is important for the users to have access to multiple choices .
